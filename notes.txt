Class & Object

class has data/attribute & func/methods
    -> attribute gets called itself, methods are called manually
    as soon as object is created, attribute is run, if you give a print statement in __init__,
    you can see. Same is not true for methods.

    __init__ is a constructor, that is run as soon as it is defined, you can add func to connect
    internet or DB here, so that user doesn't have to

    List, string, int are classes

Why OOPS? Every thing (including data types, data structure etc) are objects
    -> create your own datatype
    -> reusable
    -> debug
    -> colab


Refer to proj

Func vs method
len() is function.
obj.send() is method.

Object is needed to call the function.

--------------------------------------

Dunder method
1) __init__ constructor that helps to create attributes
More

---------------------------------------
Concept of self

Self is the object
id of self in __init__ and id of object will be Same

If a method is called obj.teaches() which doesnot need
any arguments, but self is given to it as as argument by default.
obj and self in its call are same.

Everytime a class is called, a new self is created on a different memory, and
only that self can access that class instance

----------------------------------------------------------

attributes can be created outside of the class as well.

------------------------------------------------------------

Encapsulation

some methods and some attributes are should be kept secret
