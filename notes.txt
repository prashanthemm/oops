Class & Object

class has data/attribute & func/methods
    -> attribute gets called itself, methods are called manually
    as soon as object is created, attribute is run, if you give a print statement in __init__,
    you can see. Same is not true for methods.

    __init__ is a constructor, that is run as soon as it is defined, you can add func to connect
    internet or DB here, so that user doesn't have to

    List, string, int are classes

Why OOPS? Every thing (including data types, data structure etc) are objects
    -> create your own datatype
    -> reusable
    -> debug
    -> colab
